        <p>
            This is Palantir's main page. Palantir has a very nice format that really appeals to 
            the user. With a simple navigation at the top with some text. As you scroll you 
            see more and more images and description of their company. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Contrast - This page contains very nice contract with the texting being easy to read.
                The black and white color skem really helps!
            </li>
            <li>
                Repetition - This site has very nice repetition. Repeating elements and section! 
                This makes everything very nice and confortable for the user.
            </li>
            <li>
                Alignment - The page is aligned consistently throughout the entirety. Each section 
                hold the text aligned in the same way and this creates a great user experience.
            </li>
            <li>
                Proximity - All the related elements are grouped together in a section. And all elements 
                that are separated by a dash are talking about different topics.
            </li>

        </h3>
        <p>
            The Yale School of Arts is the arts page of yale. Hosting an abudance of information about the 
            page. However, the page is using a multitude of color seems that are not consistent and appealing 
            to  the user!
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Contrast - The Background has a black color skem but another blue mini background that seems 
                out of place. This followed by a gradient color skem sections with white and yellow. This 
                contrast doesn't look nice and seems out of place. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Repetition - There are section of boxed items. However, there doesn't seem to be a pattern to them. 
                The page seems to have different boxed items for each area. Until the end, this is where they keep the 
                section with the gradient color skem.
            </li>
            <li>
                Alignment - The alignment at the beginning doesn't match the alignment at the end. This is clear beacause 
                the alignment at the beginning has items that are on centered. On the other hand, at the bottom, the items and 
                boxes are completely centered. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Proximity - They try to create nice proximity with a dark blue background, however, it doesn't turn out the best
                with that background randomly ending in the middle of sections where it should be together.
            </li>
        </ul>
