              <li>The application is a purpose tool that makes file management and manipulation much easier. It will allow users to paste a link into a search bar and it will create a download link for the user. As well, this website will be able to change the file type of a given file. For example, from .mp4 to .mov.</li>
              <li>The intended user of this website is someone who creates and edits files. Usually, this user would need files from the internet and would require this file but there would be no access to it.</li>
              <li>The page will be very simple. The page will first show a main section that is either the download feature or the file changer. Under this section, there will be more applications for use and a "buy me coffee" link.</li>
