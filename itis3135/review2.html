            1 - Complete
        </p>
        <p>
            2 - None of the files, folders, scripts, and images contain spaces or upper-case letters.
        </p>
        <p>
            3 - Design
            <ul>
                <p>a. Page does have sufficient font-size/contrast so reading is easy.</p>
                <p>b. Page has site colors and font using standard .css files.</p>
                <p>c. CRAP</p>
                <ul>
                    <p>i. Contrast - Nice use of contrast to allow reader to clearly and concisely read the page.</p>
                    <p>ii. Repetition - While I see nice repetition throughout the page, I also see a lot of inconsistent page elements.</p>
                    <p>iii. Alignment - There are a lot of elements that are aligned well, but I also see elements that are aligned awkwardly.</p>
                    <p>iv. Proximity - Proximity of elements varies throughout the website.</p>
                </ul>
            </ul> 
        </p>
        <p>4 - Page has within it</p>
            <ul>
                <p>a. Header - Nice header, I like the use of a navbar!</p>
                <p>b. Main - Nice front page.</p>
                <p>c. Footer - Nice footer, matches the style of header creating consistency.</p>
            </ul>
        <p>5 - Nice use of js to extend your header onto the html page. Header has a nice and consistent nav that follows throughout the pages. </p>
        <p>6 - Main usually start with the name of the page. However, the homepage is an exception.</p>
        <p>7 - Does not have a brand tagline execpt on the front page. I think this looks nice and doesn't need to be changed.</p>
            
        <p>8 - Page has a footer with:</p>
        <ul>
            <p>a. Designed by Wilkinson Enterprises - A link to your page.</p>
            <p>b. Page has a html validation button/link and validates.</p>
            <p>c. Page has a css validation button/link and validates.</p>
        </ul>
        <p>9 - Page has met requirement for this assignment</p>
    </p>
    <p>
        What else I noticed - I love the aesthetic and color skem! However, I think you should add more consistency with the alignment. I see some text aligned to the left, some center. I also see each page has a leave a comment feature. I think this is a redundant. I think you can only include it for one page and it will get the job done! While I like the color skem there are moments where some text color turn blues or bold. I think making these text change more consistent will enhance user experience. I also notice there are moments where text spacing inconsistently changes. Fixing this will also enhance user experience! Overall, great page!
