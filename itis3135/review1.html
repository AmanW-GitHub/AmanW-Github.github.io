        </p>
            <p>
                1 - Complete
            </p>
            <p>
                2 - None of the files, folders, scripts, and images contain spaces or upper-case letters.
            </p>
            <p>
                3 - Design
                <ul>
                    <p>a. Page does have sufficient font-size/contrast so it's easy to read.</p>
                    <p>b. Page has site colors and font using standard .css files.</p>
                    <p>c. CRAP</p>
                    <ul>
                        <p>i. Contrast - Great contrast, you choose really nice color skems and this allows for users to understand the message. </p>
                        <p>ii. Repetition - Nice use of repetition to reuse sections and formats. I love the use of images followed by sections of text.</p>
                        <p>iii. Alignment - Really nice alignment! I love the spacing between the edges and sections. </p>
                        <p>iv. Proximity - Nice use of proximity to enhance the user experience. Nice use of proximity to keep item near each other. Like text near images.</p>
                    </ul>
                </ul> 
            </p>
            <p>4 - Page has within it</p>
                <ul>
                    <p>a. Nav/Header - Nice nav/header, fits the website.</p>
                    <p>b. Main - Main section is a great intro to site.</p>
                    <p>c. Footer - Nice footer, fits the website.</p>
                </ul>
            <p>5 - Nav/Header uses nice styling to create a header that includes a navbar. This header contains a consistent styles is in each page.</p>
            <p>6 - Main section starts with a h2 that includes name of site and following that includes the content of the site in sections. The first section being the hero section.</p>
            <p>7 - Does not have a brand tagline.</p>
                
            <p>8 - Page has a footer with:</p>
            <ul>
                <p>Home - Go to the home page.</p>
                <p>Instagram - Go to the instagram.</p>
                <p>cshultz - Go to the cshultzcorp page.</p>
            </ul>
            <p>9 - Page has met requirement for this assignment</p>
        </p>
        <p>
            What else I noticed - I really love the aesthetic. However, I think you should extend the contact page to include a form for inquiries and include css and html validation. Overall, I think the site looks amazing! Great job!
